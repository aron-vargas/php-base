        We also have a large amount of smallwares: sheet pans, 
        hotel pans, bus tubs, cambros, spatulas,
        spoons, scales, etc. <span class='todo'>Weekly linen/towel service is

    <p class='mb-2'>Depending on your requirements, we can 
        allow one-time use rentals at Railside for Occasional-Use Clients.

        Members who have committed to monthly usage in our
        shared kitchen and have a health permit to operate out of our facility.
        However, if you are an established business with an 
        existing health permit, insurance, and are
        Food Safety Manager certified; then we can begin to 
        discuss our policies towards Occasional-Use
        Clients and see if our current kitchen 
        availability will meet your needs.
        Occasional-Use Clients will be required to provide 
        the same documents as regular Members.
        <span class='todo'>
