                just
                like a traditional fixed-rate, level-payment, fully amortizing mortgage. However, you make your payments
                every 14 days instead of once a month. The monthly payment is split in half, resulting in the same total
                monthly mortgage, but the resulting 26 and sometimes 27 biweekly payments a year translate into 13
                monthly
                payments, or one extra monthly payment per year.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Borrowers can qualify for a 30-year monthly payment amount, but get a loan
                that
                pays off in approximately 22 years at current interest rates. At higher rates, the actual term declines.

            <p class="glossary_definition">If you are looking to build up equity in your home faster without the higher
                mortgage payments that come with a shorter-term mortgage, you may want to consider the biweekly
                mortgage.
                Payments can be deducted from your bank account and scheduled to coincide with your payroll deposits to
                simplify budgeting. Lenders may charge an initial set-up fee to automatically debit your checking
                account.

                you
                have. This means they’ll want to know how many dependents you have and whether you pay any alimony or

            <h3>Closing Agent</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">As a potential home buyer, you will need a closing (or “settlement”) agent to

                recording
                the closing documents and disbursing funds.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The types of services provided by a closing agent depend on the person you
                hire,
                but typically the closing is conducted by title companies, escrow companies or attorneys. It is usually
                held
                at the lender’s or real estate sales professional’s office.</p>

            <h3>Closing Cost Item</h3>

                attorney’s fees. Many closing cost items are included as numbered items on the HUD-1 statement.</p>

            <h3>Closing Costs</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Expenses (over and above the price of the property) incurred by buyers and

                attorney’s fee, taxes, an amount placed in escrow, and charges for obtaining title insurance and a
                survey.
                Closing costs percentage will vary according to the area of the country; lenders or REALTORS® often
                provide
                estimates of closing costs to prospective homebuyers.</p>

            <h3>Closing Date</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">After your lender has approved your mortgage and you accept the commitment
                letter, the next step is to set a closing date. Many times, your real estate sales professional
                coordinates
                the setting of this date with you, the seller, the closing agent, and your lender.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Remember, you need to ensure that the closing occurs before your lender’s
                commitment letter - and the rate lock-in, if there is one - expire. You can now finalize your moving
                plans.

            <h3>Construction Contract</h3>

                formal,
                legally binding contract between you and your contractor - this is called the construction contract. The
                lender you choose will likely want to review this contract before you sign it.</p>

            <h3>Construction Loan</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A short-term, interim loan for financing the cost of construction. The lender
                makes payments to the builder at periodic intervals as the work progresses.</p>

            <h3>Contingencies for Repairs</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">In your purchase offer, you may consider stating that the seller must make
                sure
                the electrical systems, heating and cooling, plumbing, and mechanical systems are functioning properly
                at
                the closing. You may also state that your purchase is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of a
                professional home inspection, which will check these systems and other elements more completely. These
                are
                both ways to ensure that surprises don’t arise when your moving day arrives.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">If you do not include this clause in your contract, you are essentially
                accepting
                the house “as is.”</p>

            <h3>Contingency</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A condition that must be met before a contract is legally binding. For
                example,
                home purchasers often include a contingency that specifies that the contract is not binding until the
                purchaser obtains a satisfactory home inspection report from a qualified home inspector.</p>

            <h3>Contingency for Clear Title</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your purchase contract should include a contingency that the purchase is
                subject
                to your receiving clear title to the property. This process includes a title search and title insurance.
            </p>

            <h3>Contingency for Financing</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">When you make a formal offer on a house, your contract should include a
                financing
                contingency. It specifies if you don’t get the money you need to purchase the house at the terms you
                want,
                the offer is void and you will be refunded your deposit.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Don’t be surprised if the seller includes a clause in the contract that
                states
                you must make a “good faith effort” to get the mortgage. This is the seller’s way to ensure that you
                explore
                all options to get a mortgage loan.</p>

            <h3>Contingency for Personal Property</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your purchase contract should specify appliances, fixtures, and other
                personal
                property that must remain in the home. You can avoid any surprises by listing in your contract
                everything
                that is to be left behind when the seller moves out.</p>

            <h3>Contingency Reserve</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Most mortgages for purchase-renovation require an additional 10 percent of
                the

            <h3>Credit Profile</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">There are several ways to ensure you have a good credit report and credit
                score.
                One of the most effective is to manage your existing credit in a positive way.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Ask your lender for suggestions about ways to control the amount of money you
                owe. Or, you can choose a credit counselor from the list provided on this site. Some lenders may view
                consumers as a greater risk if they have used most or all of their available credit. Consumers who are
                considered “overextended” may be viewed this way even if they have made all their debt payments on time.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Missing a payment on a bill should be avoided, as should late payments on any
                of
                your credit obligations. Experiencing a mortgage foreclosure, filing for bankruptcy, or having your
                vehicle
                repossessed can also affect your credit score and credit report, limiting your ability to get new credit
                at
                a reasonable rate.</p>

            <h3>Credit Report</h3>

            <h3>Credit Report Fee</h3>

                report
                from a credit bureau.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">This report will verify some of the information you provided on your loan
                application as well as additional information from the credit agency’s files and from public records.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">When a credit report is received, your lender will check it against your
                application and look for any discrepancies. You may be asked to explain information in your credit
                report.
            </p>

            <h3>Credit Reporting Agency</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An organization that prepares reports that are used by lenders to determine a
                potential borrower’s credit history. The agency obtains data for these reports from a credit repository
                as
                well as from other sources.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The three main credit reporting agencies, or credit bureaus, are Equifax,
                Experian, and Trans Union. You can order a copy of your credit report (a nominal fee may apply) via
                telephone at:</p>

            <p class="glossary_notes">* Equifax: (800) 685-1111</p>

                public
                records information about the payment records of individuals who are being considered for credit.</p>

            <h3>Credit Scoring</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your credit score is based on all the information in your credit report. This
                information is converted into a number - a credit score - that the lender uses to determine whether you
                are
                likely to repay your loan in a timely manner. The scores used in mortgage lending are typically in the
                300
                to 900 range. A general guide is that the higher your score the better. But you should keep in mind that
                your credit score is just one of several factors that will be used to evaluate your mortgage loan
                application.</p>

            <h3>Credit Unions</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A credit union is a financial institution that is owned and run by its
                members.
                It is a nonprofit, cooperative institution that offers members a place to save and borrow. A credit
                union
                often works by having its members pool their funds so additional loans can be made to other members.</p>

            <h3>Creditor</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An amount owed to another. See installment loan and revolving liability.</p>

            <h3>Deed</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The legal document conveying title to a property.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The deed is the document that transfers ownership from the seller to you.
                Only
                the seller signs the deed at closing, and you’ll receive a copy of it.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The closing agent will record the deed with you listed as the new property
                owner.
                Your name and the names of any other buyers appear on the deed, and it will be sent to you after it is

                a
                trustee.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">In some states, a “deed of trust” is used instead of a mortgage. When
                homeowners
                sign a deed of trust, they receive title to the property but convey title to a neutral third party -
                called
                a trustee - until the loan balance is paid in full.</p>

            <h3>Department of Veterans Affairs</h3>

                made to
                eligible veterans of the military services. The guarantee protects the lender against loss and thus
                encourages lenders to make mortgages to veterans.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The Veterans Administration is a federal government agency authorized to
                guarantee loans made to eligible veterans under certain conditions. To obtain more information, you can
                contact the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The qualification guidelines for VA loans are more flexible than those for
                either
                the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or conventional loans.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">If you are a qualified veteran, this can be an attractive mortgage program.
                To
                determine whether you are eligible, check with your nearest VA regional office.</p>

            <p class="glossary_notes">See earnest money deposit.</p>

            <h3>Depreciation</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A decline in the value of property; the opposite of appreciation.</p>

            <h3>Detached Single-Family Home</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The most traditional type of single-family home is one that is “detached.”
                This
                type of home stands separate from any other housing structure and serves as a place of residence for the
                occupants.</p>

            <h3>Direct Leveraging Loan Program</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The Direct Leveraging Loan Program makes it easier and more economical for
                rural
                residents to own a home through lower interest rates and no down payment.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Under this program, the lender offers up to 50 percent of the mortgage amount
                as
                a conventional 30-year, fixed-rate first mortgage and the Rural Housing Service (RHS) offers the balance
                as
                a second mortgage at an interest rate that is generally below market.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The RHS is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>

            <h3>Discount points</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Discount points are often used to describe a type of fee that lenders charge.
                Discount points are additional funds you pay the lender at closing to get a lower interest rate on your
                mortgage.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A point equals 1 percent of the loan amount. So, if you and your lender agree
                to
                a mortgage of $100,000, one point would equal $1,000.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Typically, each point you pay for a 30-year loan lowers your interest rate by
                .125 of a percentage point. If the current interest rate on a 30-year mortgage is 7.75 percent, paying
                one
                point would lower the interest rate to 7.625.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Ask your lender if you have the option of paying 1, 2, or 3 discount points -
                or
                you can choose not to pay any discount points. It often makes more sense to pay discount points if you
                plan
                to stay in your home for a long time.</p>

            <h3>Dower</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The rights of a widow in the property of her husband at his death.</p>

            <h3>Down Payment</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The part of the purchase price of a property that the buyer pays in cash and
                does
                not finance with a mortgage.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Saving for a down payment is usually one of the most difficult parts of
                preparing
                to buy a home. If you believe you have the needed funds, you are in a better position to seek
                pre-qualification from a lender to get the mortgage that is right for you.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Most homeowners rely on a mortgage from a financial institution, and most
                mortgage products require buyers to include a portion of their own funds towards the purchase of the
                home.
                This is called the down payment. Lenders feel more secure when buyers include a down payment, indicating
                they are less likely to walk away from their investment if their finances take a downturn.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Historically, buyers usually made a down payment that totaled 20 percent of
                the
                home’s purchase price. Under this scenario, a down payment for a $100,000 home is $20,000. But today,
                new
                mortgage products allow buyers to put down as little as 3 percent to 5 percent, provided private
                mortgage
                insurance is obtained. The down payment for a $100,000 home with 5 percent down payment is just $5,000.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Sources for down payments may come from buyers’ savings accounts, checking
                accounts, stocks and bonds, life insurance policies, and gifts.</p>

            <h3>Due-on-sale Provision</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A provision in a mortgage that allows the lender to demand repayment in full
                if
                the borrower sells the property that serves as security for the mortgage.</p>

            <h3>Due-on-transfer Provision</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">This terminology is usually used for second mortgages.</p>

            <p class="glossary_notes">*See also “due-on-sale provision”.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A deposit made by the potential home buyer to show that he or she is serious
                about buying the house.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The earnest money deposit is a “good-faith” payment you submit with your
                offer on
                a home to show the seller you are serious about proceeding.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The earnest money is deposited in an escrow account and will be applied to
                your
                closing costs.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Sometimes, your lender will want you to bring a receipt for the earnest money
                deposit along with your sales contract to the initial loan application meeting.</p>

            <h3>Easement</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A lender determines how much equity you have in your home by taking the
                appraised
                value of the home and subtracting any mortgage debt.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">For example, if your house is valued at $150,000 and your mortgage balance is

            <h3>Errors in Credit Report</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your credit report may contain inaccuracies. The best way to ensure there are
                no
                errors in your credit report is to request copies and review the information.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Since each of the main credit bureaus keeps its own records, you may want to
                request copies from all three: Trans Union, Equifax, and Experian.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">If you have been turned down for credit because of the information in your
                credit
                report, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your report within 60 days of the denial. If you
                haven’t
                been denied credit, you can still request a copy of your credit report, usually for a nominal fee.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">If you find errors in your report, follow the directions in the credit report
                and
                contact the agencies to have the errors corrected. They will investigate the targeted items and remove
                incorrect information.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">You don’t have to delay applying for a mortgage while errors in your report
                are
                being corrected. Explain the discrepancies in the report to your lender and state that the credit agency
                is
                correcting them.</p>

                with an
                attorney or escrow agent to be disbursed upon the closing of a sale of real estate.</p>

            <h3>Escrow Account</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The account in which a mortgage servicer holds the borrower’s escrow payments
                prior to paying property expenses.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An escrow account is money that is deposited with a third party - outside the
                buyer and the seller - to be used to pay various fees. A borrower typically provides funds that will pay
                taxes, mortgage insurance, lease payments, hazard insurance premiums, and other payments when they are
                due.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An escrow payment by the holder of a mortgage is also known as “impounds” or
                “reserves” in some states.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">When escrow funds are used to pay taxes, hazard insurance, and other fees, it
                is
                called an escrow disbursement. Periodically, an escrow analysis will be performed to determine if
                current
                monthly deposits provide sufficient funds to pay bills when they are due.</p>

            <h3>Escrow Analysis</h3>

                Known
                as “impounds” or “reserves” in some states.</p>

            <h3>Establishing a Credit Report</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">It is possible to establish a credit history even if you do not have a
                traditional credit record that shows credit card payments or payments on a student or car loan.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">You can build a nontraditional credit history, for example, by documenting
                your
                monthly payments to previous and current landlords; to utility companies for your gas, water and
                telephone
                services; and to insurance companies for medical, life, and automobile coverage.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your lender can provide further details on how you can effectively establish
                a
                credit record.</p>

                percent to 5 percent of the FHA appraised value or the purchase price, whichever is lower.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">FHA mortgages have a maximum loan limit that varies depending on the average
                cost
                of housing in a given region. In general, the loan limit is less than what is available with a

                property you want to purchase within the 24 hours before closing.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">This walk-through, during which you will be accompanied by the real estate
                sales
                professional, is your chance to ensure that the seller has vacated the house and left behind whatever
                property was agreed upon.</p>

                been met. If they aren’t, or you observe major problems, you have the right to delay the closing until
                the
                problems are corrected.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">One other option is to make sure money to correct the problems is placed in

            <h3>Financial Index</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An index is a number to which the interest rate on an adjustable rate
                mortgage
                (ARM) is tied. It is generally a published number expressed as a percentage, such as the average
                interest
                rate or yield on U.S. Treasury bills. A margin is added to the index to determine the interest rate that
                will be charged on ARMs. This interest rate is subject to any caps associated with the mortgage.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The interest rate changes on an ARM are tied to some type of financial index.
                Some of the most common type of indexed ARMs are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Treasury-Indexed ARMs</li>
                <li>CD-Indexed ARMs (Certificate of Deposit)</li>
                <li>Cost of Funds-Indexed ARMs (COFI)</li>
                <li>LIBOR-Based ARMs</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">When comparing ARMs, look at how the index to which it is tied has performed
                recently. Your lender can provide information on how to track the index and a history of the index they
                use.
            </p>

            <h3>Finders Fee</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A fee or commission paid to a mortgage broker for finding a mortgage loan for

                property.</p>

            <h3>First Mortgage</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage that is the primary lien against a property.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A “first mortgage” is the primary lien against a property. The term is
                usually
                coined “first mortgage” only when a “second mortgage” is obtained on a property. A “second mortgage” is
                a
                lien that is subordinate to the first mortgage. Usually, the interest rates on second mortgages are
                slightly
                higher than the interest rates on a first mortgage. The amount of a second mortgage you can take out
                will
                depend on the equity you have built up in your home, the appraised value of your property, your credit
                history, and any other liens you may have against your property, such as a home equity line of credit.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Borrowers will typically get a second mortgage to tap into the equity they’ve
                built in their home - and use that for home improvements, debt consolidation, medical bills, or other
                purposes. You apply for a second mortgage with the same process you follow for a first mortgage.
                However,
                some of your closing costs may be less.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">When you have a first and second mortgage, you theoretically have two loans,
                both
                requiring interest and principal payments.</p>

            <h3>Fixed Installment</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The monthly payment due on a mortgage loan. The fixed installment includes
                payment of both principal and interest.</p>

            <h3>Fixed-Period Adjustable-Rate Mortgages</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">This type of adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) maintains the same initial
                interest
                rate for the first three, five, seven, or 10 years of your loan, depending on the term you choose. Your
                interest rate then adjusts annually, and can move up or down as market conditions change. Be sure to ask
                your lender about the interest rate caps for both the annual adjustments and for the life of the loan.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your initial interest rate will be lower than a fixed-rate mortgage, so you may be able to afford
                    more
                    home.</li>
                <li>You are protected against interest rate increases for the first three, five, seven, or 10 years of
                    the
                    loan, depending on which type of fixed-period ARM you choose.</li>
                <li>You may have the option to convert your ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage at the first, second, or third
                    interest rate adjustment dates.</li>
                <li>You have time to improve your financial position (i.e. salary increases) or accumulate additional
                    assets
                    before the interest rate adjusts at the end of the fixed period.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Details:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The lifetime interest rate cap for fixed-period ARMs is typically 5 to 6 percentage points above
                    your
                    initial rate. Your annual cap during the adjustable period is typically 1 to 2 percentage points
                    above
                    or below over the current rate.</li>
                <li>Can be used to buy one- to four-family residences including second homes and condos, co-ops and
                    planned
                    unit developments. Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must be built
                    on a
                    permanent chassis at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and attached to a
                    foundation.)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fixed-Rate Mortgage</h3>

            <p>A mortgage in which the interest rate does not change during the entire term of the loan.</p>

            <p>Fixed-rate mortgages, the most popular type of mortgage, offer the peace of mind that your interest rate
                will
                remain the same for as long as you have your loan. If you expect to live in your home for many years,
                having
                the same interest rate may be your key concern. If you decide that you like the stable, predictable
                payments
                of a fixed-rate loan, you have the option of choosing from a variety of repayment terms: 15, 20, and 30
                years are the most common. Typically, the longer the term of the mortgage, the more interest you pay
                over
                the life of your loan. However, stretching out your repayment term means your monthly mortgage payments
                will
                be less than they would be with a comparable shorter-term mortgage. Lenders offer a wide array of
                fixed-rate
                mortgages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Balloon Mortgages</li>
                <li>Biweekly Mortgages</li>
            </ul>

                properties located in federally designated flood areas.</p>

            <h3>Foreclosure</h3>

            <p>The legal process by which a borrower in default under a mortgage is deprived of his or her interest in
                the
                mortgaged property. This usually involves a forced sale of the property at public auction with the
                proceeds
                of the sale being applied to the mortgage debt.</p>

            <p>If you repeatedly do not make your mortgage payments on time, your lender could sell your home and evict
                you
                from it in a legal procedure called foreclosure. A foreclosure on your property can result in the loss
                of
                your home and your good credit rating. Foreclosure is most often a last resort effort that lenders will
                take
                if you repeatedly don’t make your mortgage payments. Before going to foreclosure, lenders will work with
                you
                if you are facing financial hardships to come up with repayment plans that will let you get back on
                track
                and remain in your home.</p>

                you
                will incur to get your mortgage. It is based on the lender’s typical loan origination costs for the area
                where your home is located. The estimate usually changes between application and closing, so you’ll want
                to
                review your settlement form before the closing meeting.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The settlement form will list the actual amount of money you’ll need to bring
                to
                closing. You’ll need to pay your closing costs in the form of a certified or cashier’s check because
                personal checks usually are not accepted.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A special type of mortgage that enables older home owners to convert the
                equity
                they have in their homes into cash, using a variety of payment options to address their specific
                financial
                needs. Unlike traditional home equity loans, a borrower does not qualify on the basis of income but on
                the
                value of his or her home. In addition, the loan does not have to be repaid until the borrower no longer
                occupies the property. Sometimes called a reverse mortgage.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) is a type of home loan that lets
                homeowners aged 62 or over with little or no remaining balance on their mortgage convert their equity
                into
                cash. The equity can be paid to the homeowner in a lump sum, in a stream of payments, draws from a line
                of
                credit, or a combination of monthly payments and line of credit.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Whatever payment plan you select, you do not have to repay any part of this
                reverse mortgage until you sell the home or vacate it for another reason. At that time, you pay the loan
                balance, plus any accrued interest. Any proceeds above that amount go to you or to your estate.</p>

            <p>Developed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the HECM mortgage provides a cash growth feature
                not
                found with some other reverse mortgages - check with your Fannie Mae approved lender to see how this
                works
                based on your personal needs and your payment plan.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The funds are yours to spend in any way you choose.</li>
                <li>There are no monthly payments with a HECM.</li>
                <li>Your loan funds do not affect Social Security or Medicare benefits. (If you receive Supplemental
                    Social
                    Security or Medicaid, these benefits may be affected.)</li>
                <li>You do not have to pay back the loan until you sell your home or no longer use it for your primary
                    residence. Then, you or your estate will repay the cash you received from the HECM, plus interest
                    and
                    other finance charges to the lender. This means that the remaining equity in your home can be passed
                    on
                    to your heirs through the sale of the property.</li>
                <li>You will never owe more than the value of the home at the time of repayment, even if the loan
                    balance
                    exceeds the value of your property. This means no debt will ever be passed along to the estate or
                    your
                    heirs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Details:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You and any co-borrowers must be at least 62 years old.</li>
                <li>You must own your home outright - or carry a small mortgage balance.</li>
                <li>Eligible properties include a single-family home, a two- to four-unit dwelling, a condominium or a
                    manufactured home. All housing types must meet Federal Housing Administration (FHA) guidelines. (Ask
                    your lender if your property qualifies.)</li>
                <li>Your home must be your principal residence, which means you must live in it more than half the year.
                </li>
                <li>You must attend pre-application mortgage counseling before you apply for the loan.</li>
                <li>You must keep applicable taxes current, as well as maintain insurance coverage on your home.</li>
                <li>The amount you can borrow with a HECM depends on the age of the youngest borrower(s), the interest
                    rate,
                    how much your house is worth, and the maximum claim amount. In general, you can get between
                    one-third
                    and one-half of your equity as a line of credit or as a lump sum payment.</li>
                <li>The balance of funds advanced against the equity in your home is due and payable when you relinquish
                    your home as a primary residence, or if the borrower(s) pass away. You may have to pay off the debt
                    if
                    you fail to pay property taxes or insurance or if you do not maintain your property.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Home Equity Line of Credit</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage loan, which is usually in a subordinate position, that allows the
                borrower to obtain multiple advances of the loan proceeds at his or her own discretion, up to an amount
                that
                represents a specified percentage of the borrower’s equity in a property.</p>

            <h3>Home Inspection</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A thorough inspection that evaluates the structural and mechanical condition
                of a
                property. A satisfactory home inspection is often included as a contingency by the purchaser. Contrast
                with
                appraisal.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The home inspection reviews the structural and mechanical condition of the
                property. This is not an evaluation of the market value of the home or a determination of whether the
                home
                complies with applicable building and safety codes. The inspection does not include a recommendation on
                whether you should or should not buy the house.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The inspector bases the findings on observable structural elements of the
                home.
                Potential home buyers are urged to be present during the inspection - this will allow you to ask
                questions
                and be in a better position to learn more about any problems that arise.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">You should expect to see an evaluation of:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>roof and siding,</li>
                <li>windows and doors,</li>
                <li>foundation,</li>
                <li>insulation,</li>
                <li>ventilation,</li>
                <li>heating and cooling systems,</li>
                <li>plumbing and electrical systems,</li>
                <li>walls, floors, and ceilings,</li>
                <li>and any common areas if you are purchasing a condominium or cooperative.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">You should view the home inspection report as a way to identify problems
                before
                you buy the home, to help negotiate adjustments in the purchase price if problems exist, and to help get
                the
                buyer to make any needed improvements before you buy the home.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Lastly - and for some buyers most importantly - the home inspection report is
                a
                way to make you feel confident that the home you are buying includes systems that are in good working
                condition.</p>

            <h3>Homeowners Association</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A nonprofit association that manages the common areas of a planned unit
                development (PUD) or condominium project. In a condominium project, it has no ownership interest in the
                common elements. In a PUD project, it holds title to the common elements.</p>

            <h3>Homeowners Insurance</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Homeowner’s insurance -- also called “hazard insurance” - should be equal to
                at
                least the replacement cost of the property you want to purchase. Replacement cost coverage ensures that
                your
                home will be fully rebuilt in case of a total loss.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Most home buyers purchase a homeowner’s insurance policy that includes
                personal
                liability insurance in case someone is injured on their property; personal property coverage for loss
                and
                damage to personal property due to theft or other events; and dwelling coverage to protect the house
                against
                fire, theft, weather damage, and other hazards.</p>

            <p>If the home you want to buy is located near water, you may be able to get flood insurance as part of your
                homeowner’s protection. In fact, it may be required in some areas, so check with your real estate
                professional or an approved lender for further information.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Seek out and compare rates from several insurance companies before making
                your
                final decision.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Lenders often want the first year’s premium to be paid at or before closing.
                Your
                lender may add the insurance cost to your monthly mortgage payments and keep this portion of your
                payments
                in an escrow account. The lender then pays your insurance bill out of escrow when it receives premium
                notices from your insurance company.</p>

            <h3>Homeowners Warranty</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A type of insurance that covers repairs to specified parts of a house for a
                specific period of time. It is provided by the builder or property seller as a condition of the sale.
            </p>

            <h3>HomeStyle Construction-to-Permanent Mortgage</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">This mortgage gives you the financial power to build your own home - you can
                borrow money to build a home from the ground up or to finish building a home that’s currently under
                construction. This loan provides financing from the construction through the purchase phases of your new
                home.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

            <ul>

                <li>You can borrow a minimum of 95 percent of the construction cost or the as-completed value of the

                <li>You can use this mortgage to purchase land upon which you build your home.</li>
                <li>You save money because there is one set of closing costs, compared to those associated with separate

                <li>This loan is available for one- and two-unit owner-occupied homes, one-unit second homes, and
                    one-unit

                <li>You can choose a 15- or 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. You can also include the construction phase in
                    these terms, or not, depending on your preference.</li>
                <li>You can also finance with fixed-period ARMs.</li>
            </ul>

                (ARM).
                The index is generally a published number or percentage, such as the average interest rate or yield on
                Treasury bills. A margin is added to the index to determine the interest rate that will be charged on
                the
                ARM. This interest rate is subject to any caps that are associated with the mortgage.</p>

            <h3>Inflation</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An increase in the amount of money or credit available in relation to the

            <p class="glossary_definition">The original interest rate of the mortgage at the time of closing. This rate
                changes for an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). Sometimes known as “start rate” or “teaser.”</p>

                interest
                rate, as specified in the mortgage note; the interest rate floor is the minimum interest rate, as

                it
                is also the rate used to calculate the monthly payments, although it is not used for an adjustable-rate
                mortgage (ARM) with payment change limitations.</p>

                early
                years of a mortgage. During the specified period, the mortgagor’s effective interest rate is “bought
                down”
                below the actual interest rate.</p>

            <h3>Interest Rate Ceiling</h3>

                or
                yearly. It is tied to the weekly average yield of U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant
                maturity
                of one year. The interest charged on the HECM loan will be payable to your lender when the loan
                terminates.

            <h3>LIBOR-based ARMs</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is based on the interest rate that

                London
                interbank market. The LIBOR is similar to the prime-lending rate posted by major U.S. banks.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">You can select an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) that adjusts to the LIBOR at
                specified periods, usually every six months. This type of ARM typically has a per-adjustment period cap

            </p>

            <h3>Loan Application</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The loan application is a detailed form designed to provide information from
                you
                that your lender will need. Lenders use the application to evaluate whether or not they can give you a
                loan,
                and if so, the amount of money they can lend you. The “four Cs” of credit come into play when filling
                out an
                application -- they are capacity, credit history, capital and collateral.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The loan application form requests information such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>bank account balances and account numbers, as well as bank branch address;</li>
                <li>information about where you work or what sources of income you have;</li>
                <li>outstanding debts (including loans and credit cards with names and addresses of creditors).</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Information needed for the loan application may vary from lender to lender,
                so
                prior to filling out the application it’s important to discuss with your lender what items your lender
                will
                need.</p>

            <h3>Loan Commitment</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The commitment letter states the dollar amount of the loan being offered, the
                number of years you have to repay the loan, the loan origination fee, the points, the annual percentage
                rate, and the monthly charges.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The letter also states the time you have to accept the loan offer and to
                close
                the loan. Make sure you understand all aspects of the commitment letter because by signing it, you
                indicate
                your acceptance of its terms and conditions.</p>

            <h3>Loan Limit</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The limit on the size of a mortgage which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will
                purchase and/or guarantee. The conforming loan limit is set annually by Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s
                federal regulator, The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). OFHEO uses the October to
                October percentage increase/decrease in the average house price in the monthly interest rate survey of
                the
                Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) to adjust the conforming loan limits for the subsequent year.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Mortgages which exceed the conforming loan limit are known as jumbo
                mortgages.
                The interest rate on jumbo mortgages can be higher than the interest rate on conforming mortgages. A
                borrower whose mortgage amount slightly exceeds the conforming loan limit should analyze the economics
                of
                reducing their loan size through a larger downpayment or possibly using secondary financing to qualify
                for a
                conforming mortgage verses a jumbo mortgage.</p>

            <h3>Loan Origination</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The process by which a mortgage lender brings into existence a mortgage
                secured
                by real property.</p>

            <h3>Loan Origination Fee</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The loan origination fee covers the administrative costs of processing the
                loan.
                It is often expressed in points. One point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">For example, a $100,000 mortgage with a loan origination fee of 1 point would
                mean you pay $1,000.</p>

            <h3>Loan Terms and Conditions</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">With a reverse mortgage, a lender can call in your loan under certain
                conditions.
                But, if you occupy the property as your primary residence, are not absent from the property for 12
                consecutive months.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">You may instruct the lender to pay the taxes and insurance on your behalf
                from
                your reverse mortgage funds. The lender will set aside funds from your reverse mortgage to pay for
                future
                taxes and insurance, as long as funds are available.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Furthermore, as long as you comply with the terms noted above, you can’t be
                forced to sell your home to pay off the reverse mortgage, even if the loan balance grows to exceed the
                value
                of your property.</p>

            <h3>Loan-to-Value (LTV) Percentage</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The relationship between the principal balance of the mortgage and the
                appraised
                value (or sales price if it is lower) of the property. For example, a $100,000 home with an $80,000
                mortgage
                has a LTV percentage of 80 percent.</p>

            <h3>Lock-In</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A written agreement in which the lender guarantees a specified interest rate
                if a
                mortgage goes to closing within a set period of time. The lock-in also usually specifies the number of
                points to be paid at closing.</p>

            <h3>Lock-In Period</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The time period during which the lender has guaranteed an interest rate to a
                borrower.</p>

            <h3>Manufactured Housing</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Homes and dwellings that are not built at the home site and are moved to the
                location are considered manufactured housing. Manufactured housing units must be built on a permanent
                chassis at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and attached to a foundation. All
                manufactured
                homes must be built to meet standards set forth by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
                (HUD). The standards focus on such aspects as design, strength, energy efficiency, and fire resistance.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Manufactured housing represents one of the fastest-growing housing markets in
                the
                United States. Nearly all of the mortgage products are available for owners of manufactured housing.</p>

            <h3>Margin</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">For an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the amount that is added to the index
                to
                establish the interest rate on each adjustment date, subject to any limitations on the interest rate
                change.
            </p>

            <h3>Market Value</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">You can get a good feel for the market value of a home by asking whether the
                listing agent compiled a “comparative market analysis (CMA)”. This written report on the property
                examines
                comparable homes in the area that have recently been sold, are currently on the market, or are currently
                under contract.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The CMA will help you figure out whether the asking price is in line with
                other
                comparable houses in the neighborhood.</p>

            <h3>Master Association</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A homeowners’ association in a large condominium or planned unit development
                (PUD) project that is made up of representatives from associations covering specific areas within the
                project. In effect, it is a “second-level” association that handles matters affecting the entire
                development, while the “first-level” associations handle matters affecting their particular portions of
                the
                project.</p>

            <h3>Maturity</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The date on which the principal balance of a loan, bond, or other financial
                instrument becomes due and payable.</p>

            <h3>Maximum Claim Amount</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your maximum claim amount is the lesser of two figures:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your home’s appraised value.</li>
                <li>HUD 203(b) limit.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The HUD 203(b) limit is the maximum loan amount that FHA will insure for
                residences in your geographical area. Check with your lender to get the latest figures for your area.
            </p>

            <h3>Maximum Financing</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage amount that is within 5 percent of the highest loan-to-value (LTV)
                percentage allowed for a specific product. Thus, maximum financing on a fixed-rate mortgage would be 90
                percent or higher, because 95 percent is the maximum allowable LTV percentage for that product.</p>

            <h3>Merged Credit Report</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A credit report that contains information from three credit repositories.
                When
                the report is created, the information is compared for duplicate entries. Any duplicates are combined to
                provide a summary of a your credit.</p>

            <h3>Modification</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The act of changing any of the terms of the mortgage.</p>

            <h3>Money Market Account</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A savings account that provides bank depositors with many of the advantages
                of a
                money market fund. Certain regulatory restrictions apply to the withdrawal of funds from a money market
                account.</p>

            <h3>Money Market Fund</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A mutual fund that allows individuals to participate in managed investments
                in
                short-term debt securities, such as certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Fixed Installment</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">That portion of the total monthly payment that is applied toward principal
                and
                interest. When a mortgage negatively amortizes, the monthly fixed installment does not include any
                amount
                for principal reduction.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Payment Mortgage</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage that requires payments to reduce the debt once a month.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your monthly mortgage payment is composed of four components.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Principal refers to the part of the monthly payment that reduces the remaining balance of the
                    mortgage.
                </li>
                <li>Interest is the fee charged for borrowing money.</li>
                <li>Taxes and insurance refer to the amounts that are paid into an escrow account each month for
                    property
                    taxes and mortgage and hazard insurance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">All four of these elements are often referred to as PITI.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your monthly mortgage payment due may be mailed to you in a book of coupons
                each
                year, or in a separate coupon every month.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Ask your lender if the automated underwriting system is used, which may
                reduce
                costs associated with your mortgage.</p>

            <h3>Mortgage</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A legal document that pledges a property to the lender as security for
                payment of
                a debt.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Simply put, the mortgage is the legal document that gives the lender a legal
                claim against your house should you default on your loan payments. The mortgage indicates that a
                specific
                amount of money will be loaned at a specific interest rate so that you can buy your home. Another way of
                thinking of the mortgage is that you have possession of the property but the lender has ownership until
                you
                have repaid your loan.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The items stated in the mortgage include the homeowner’s responsibility to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>pay principal</li>
                <li>pay interest</li>
                <li>pay taxes</li>
                <li>pay insurance on time</li>
                <li>pay to maintain hazard insurance on the property</li>
                <li>adequately maintain the property</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The mortgage also includes the basic information found in the note.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Should you consistently fail to meet these requirements, your lender can seek
                full repayment of the balance of the loan, foreclose on the property, or sell the property and use the
                proceeds to pay off the loan balance and foreclosure costs.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A deed of trust is used instead of a mortgage in some states.</p>

            <h3>Mortgage Banker</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A company that originates mortgages exclusively for resale in the secondary
                mortgage market.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Mortgage companies originate and service mortgages. In other words, they make
                loans to consumers. Mortgage companies then typically sell these loans to other lenders and investors.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Some mortgage companies may be subsidiaries of depository institutions or
                their
                holding companies but do not receive money from individual depositors.</p>

            <h3>Mortgage Broker</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An individual or company that brings borrowers and lenders together for the
                purpose of loan origination. Mortgage brokers typically require a fee or a commission for their
                services.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The National Association of Mortgage Brokers defines a mortgage broker as “an
                independent real estate financing professional who specializes in the origination of residential and/or
                commercial mortgages.”</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">There are an estimated 20,000 mortgage brokerage operations from coast to
                coast.
                They originate more than half of the residential loans in the U.S.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A mortgage broker has professional expertise that can assist mortgage seekers
                in
                finding the best loan for them. The mortgage broker is also experienced in offering many applicable
                financing options for a consumer’s specific needs.</p>

            <h3>Mortgage Insurance</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A contract that insures the lender against loss caused by a mortgagor’s
                default
                on a government mortgage or conventional mortgage. Mortgage insurance can be issued by a private company
                or
                by a government agency such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Depending on the type of
                mortgage
                insurance, the insurance may cover a percentage of or virtually all of the mortgage loan.</p>

            <h3>Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP)</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The amount paid by a mortgagor for mortgage insurance, either to a government
                agency such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or to a private mortgage insurance (MI) company.
            </p>

            <h3>Mortgage Life Insurance</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A type of term life insurance often bought by mortgagors. The amount of
                coverage
                decreases as the principal balance declines. In the event that the borrower dies while the policy is in
                force, the debt is automatically satisfied by insurance proceeds.</p>

            <h3>Mortgage-Related Closing Costs</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Mortgage-related closing costs generally are costs associated with your loan
                application. They vary, but here are some of the most common ones:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Loan origination fee: This fee covers the administrative costs of processing the loan. It may be
                    expressed as a percentage of the loan (for example, 1 percent of the mortgage amount).</li>
                <li>Loan discount points: These points are additional funds you pay the lender at closing to get a lower
                    interest rate on your mortgage. Typically, each point you pay for a 30-year loan lowers your
                    interest
                    rate by .125 of a percentage point. If the current interest rate on a no-point, 30-year mortgage is
                    7.75
                    percent, paying one point would lower the interest rate to 7.625. Each point is one percent of the
                    mortgage (for example, if your mortgage is $200,000, one point equals $2,000).</li>
                <li>Appraisal fee: This fee pays for the appraisal, which the lender uses to determine whether the value
                    of
                    the property secures the loan should you default. The home buyer usually pays this fee. It may
                    appear on
                    the settlement form as “POC,” or “paid outside closing.”</li>
                <li>Credit report fee: This covers the cost of the credit report, which the lender uses to determine
                    your
                    creditworthiness.</li>
                <li>Assumption fee: This fee is charged if you take over the payments on the seller’s existing loan. It
                    may
                    range from hundreds of dollars to one percent of the loan amount.</li>
                <li>Prepaid interest: You are charged interest when you borrow money from a lender, and you will pay
                    interest on the mortgage amount from the date of settlement to the beginning of the period covered
                    by
                    the first monthly mortgage payment. At closing, you may be required to pay in advance the interest
                    for
                    the period.</li>
                <li>Escrow accounts: Also called reserves, these accounts are required if your lender will be paying
                    your
                    homeowner’s insurance and property taxes. Your lender sets up the escrow account by adding the cost
                    of
                    the insurance and taxes to your monthly mortgage payments. It is kept in reserve until the bills are
                    due. The bills are sent directly to your lender, who makes the payments for you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><a name="_N">N</a></h2>

            <h3>Negative Amortization</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A gradual increase in mortgage debt that occurs when the monthly payment is
                not
                large enough to cover the entire principal and interest due. The amount of the shortfall is added to the
                remaining balance to create “negative” amortization.</p>

            <h3>Net Cash Flow</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The income that remains for an investment property after the monthly
                operating
                income is reduced by the monthly housing expense, which includes principal, interest, taxes, and
                insurance
                (PITI) for the mortgage, homeowners’ association dues, leasehold payments, and subordinate financing
                payments.</p>

            <h3>No Cash-Out Refinance</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A refinance transaction in which the new mortgage amount is limited to the
                sum of
                the remaining balance of the existing first mortgage, closing costs (including prepaid items), points,
                the
                amount required to satisfy any mortgage liens that are more than one year old (if the borrower chooses
                to
                satisfy them), and other funds for the borrower’s use (as long as the amount does not exceed 1 percent
                of
                the principal amount of the new mortgage).</p>

            <h3>Non-Liquid Asset</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An asset that cannot easily be converted into cash.</p>

            <h3>Note</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A legal document that obligates a borrower to repay a mortgage loan at a
                stated
                interest rate during a specified period of time.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">One way to think of the mortgage note is that it is a legal “IOU.” Often
                called
                the promissory note, it represents your promise to pay the lender according to the agreed upon terms of
                the
                loan, including when and where to send your payment.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The note lists any penalties that will be assessed if you don’t make your
                monthly
                mortgage payments. It also warns you that the lender can “call” the loan - demand repayment of the
                entire
                loan before the end of the term - if you violate the terms of your mortgage.</p>

            <h3>Note Rate</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The interest rate stated on a mortgage note.</p>

            <h3>Notice of Default</h3>

            <h2><a name="_O">O</a></h2>

            <h3>Occupancy Date</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">This provision is a good way to help ensure that your home will be ready for
                occupancy after the closing takes place. As part of your formal purchase offer, consider including a
                provision that holds the seller responsible for paying you rent should they not move out on or prior to
                the
                agreed-upon date. This allows you, for example, to use the money you receive to pay your own rent if you
                are
                leasing your current residence.</p>

            <h3>Offer</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">When you make an offer on a house, it means you are making a formal bid to
                buy a
                home. You can work with your real estate sales professional to put together a written bid that abides by
                the
                laws in your state. Your offer should include such aspects as the address of the home, the sales price,
                the
                type of mortgage financing you will use to purchase the home, any personal property that might be
                included
                as part of the sale, and a target date for closing and occupancy. An earnest money deposit typically
                accompanies the offer. Your real estate sales professional can provide guidance on other elements of the
                offer.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Once you have made an offer, the seller has the opportunity to accept,
                decline,
                or make a counter-offer. If your offer is accepted, you have a ratified sales contract. This contract is
                the
                starting point for working with an approved lender to get the mortgage that’s right for you.</p>

            <h3>One-Year Adjustable-Rate Mortgage</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">This adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) offers a low initial interest rate with
                an
                interest rate that adjusts annually after the first year. The rate cap per annual adjustment is usually
                2
                percent; the lifetime adjustment caps can be 5 percent or 6 percent. This type of mortgage may be right
                for
                you if you anticipate a rapid increase in income over the first few years of your mortgage. That’s
                because
                it lets you maximize your purchasing power immediately. It may also be the right mortgage for you if you
                plan to live in your home for only a few years.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Maximizes your buying power immediately, especially if you expect your income to rise quickly in the
                    next few years.</li>
                <li>A low first-year interest rate and a 2 percent annual rate cap.</li>
                <li>Some one-year ARMs let you convert to a fixed-rate loan at certain adjustment intervals.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Ask your approved lender which of their one-year ARMs include this option.
                Generally, conversions to fixed-rate mortgages are allowed at the third, fourth, or fifth interest rate
                adjustment dates.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Details:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You can get a one-year ARM with a term from 10 to 30 years. The most typical ones are 10, 15, or 30
                    years.</li>
                <li>The one-year ARM is most often indexed to the weekly average yield of U.S. Treasury securities
                    adjusted
                    to a constant maturity of one year.</li>
                <li>Can be used to buy one-family, principal residences, including condos, and planned unit
                    developments.
                </li>
                <li>Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must be built on a permanent
                    chassis
                    at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ongoing Costs</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Home buyers should not forget that there are on-going costs associated with
                owning a home. They include, but are not limited to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Monthly mortgage payment</li>
                <li>Mortgage insurance</li>
                <li>Homeowner’s insurance</li>
                <li>Property taxes</li>
                <li>Utilities, such as gas, oil, water and electricity</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Another cost home buyers should consider is how much it will cost to maintain
                their home. These costs include everything from cleaning and minor repairs to yard work and painting.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Condominium owners and people living in planned unit developments should
                factor
                in any homeowners’ association fees or similar costs.</p>

            <h3>Original Principal Balance</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The total amount of principal owed on a mortgage before any payments are
                made.
            </p>

            <h3>Origination Fee</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A fee paid to a lender for processing a loan application. The origination fee
                is
                stated in the form of points. One point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The loan origination fee covers the administrative costs of processing the
                loan.
                It is often expressed in points. One point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount. For example, a $100,000
                mortgage with a loan origination fee of 1 point would mean you pay $1,000.</p>

            <h3>Other Buyer Costs</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">There are other costs associated with the closing that are typically paid by
                the
                buyer. They often include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fees paid to the lender: Loan discount points, loan origination fee, credit report fee, appraisal
                    fee,
                    and assumption fee.</li>
                <li>Advance payments or prepaid fees: Interest, mortgage insurance premium, and hazard insurance
                    premium.
                </li>
                <li>Escrow accounts or reserves: State and local law and lenders’ policies vary but these reserves may
                    have
                    to be set up if the lender will be paying property taxes, mortgage insurance, and hazard insurance.
                </li>
                <li>Title charges: Closing (or settlement) fee, title insurance premium, title search, document
                    preparation
                    fees, and attorney fees. The fees the buyer pays for a real estate attorney are not part of
                    settlement
                    procedures.</li>
                <li>Recording and transfer fees: States often impose a tax on the transfer of property. The payment of a
                    fee
                    for recording the purchasing documents may be required.</li>
                <li>Additional charges: Surveyor’s fees, termite and other pet infestation inspection fees, and the cost
                    of
                    other inspections required by the lender.</li>
                <li>Adjustments: Items paid by the seller in advance and items yet to be paid for which the seller is
                    responsible. The most common expense is property taxes, but others may have to be addressed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Other Contingencies</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A contingency in a contract states that if a certain requirement is not met,
                the
                deal can be canceled. Some of the most common contingencies related to home purchases include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Professional home inspection: This states that your sales contract is contingent on a satisfactory
                    report by a professional home inspector. You have the right not to proceed with the purchase of the
                    home, or to re-negotiate the terms of purchase, if any major problems are uncovered.</li>
                <li>Termite inspection: This states that the property is free of both visible termite infestation and
                    termite damage.</li>
                <li>Asbestos: You may choose to hire a qualified professional to inspect the home, take samples for
                    asbestos, and offer solutions to correct any problems.</li>
                <li>Formaldehyde: This colorless, gas chemical was used in foam insulation for homes until the early
                    1980s
                    and is emitted by some construction materials. It is suspected of causing cancer, and it can also
                    irritate the throat, nose, and eyes. A qualified inspector can let you know if the gas is present in
                    the
                    home you wish to purchase.</li>
                <li>Radon: Most home buyers require that the house be tested for radon, a naturally occurring, odorless
                    gas
                    that can cause health problems.</li>
                <li>Hazardous waste sites: The Environmental Protection Agency has identified contaminated hazardous
                    waste
                    sites across the country. You can contact your EPA regional office for more information.</li>
                <li>Lead-based paint: You should also have the house inspected for lead-based paint, which can lead to
                    very
                    serious health problems. If the house was built before 1950, you can be fairly certain lead-based
                    paint
                    was used. For houses built between 1950 and 1978, there is also a chance lead-based paint was used.
                    Lead
                    disclosure regulations can vary from state to state. Health officials in the state where the home
                    you
                    want to buy is located may be able to provide further guidance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The seller or real estate professional must give you a pamphlet that explains
                lead hazards and tell you about any lead-based paint of which the seller is aware before a sales
                contract on
                a home built before 1978 can be finalized. The seller must also allow 10 days during which you can hire
                a
                professional to conduct an inspection for lead-based paint hazards.</p>

            <h3>Other Financial Companies</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Other financial companies include credit unions, mortgage brokers, insurance
                companies, investment bankers, and housing finance agencies.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Credit unions are cooperative, not-for-profit institutions organized to
                promote
                savings and to provide credit, including mortgage loans, to their members. Credit unions either service
                the
                mortgages they originate or sell them to other investors.</p>

            <p>Mortgage brokers are independent real estate financing professionals who specialize in the origination of
                residential and/or commercial mortgages. Mortgage brokers originate loans on behalf of other lenders --
                including banks, thrifts and mortgage banking companies, but do not service loans.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Insurance companies and investment bankers are large institutional investors
                in
                mortgages that do not receive deposits from consumers. They use premiums from their clients’ insurance
                polices and investment packages to fund their mortgage lending activities.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Housing finance agencies are typically associated with state or local
                governments. They are generally geared toward assisting first-time and low- to moderate-income
                borrowers.
                They use tax exempt bonds to fund mortgage lending and as a result are often able to provide interest
                rates
                that are below current market rates.</p>

            <h3>Owner Financing</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A property purchase transaction in which the property seller provides all or
                part
                of the financing.</p>

            <h3>Permits</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">With most major home improvement projects, work permits may be required.

                indication
                of how much money you will be eligible to borrow when you apply for a mortgage. This process occurs
                before

            <h2><a name="_Q">Q</a></h2>

            <h3>Qualifying Guidelines</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">There are two main elements lenders consider when determining whether you and
                any
                co-borrowers qualify for a specific mortgage.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The first is your monthly mortgage costs, including mortgage payments,
                property
                taxes and insurance. If you’re considering buying a condominium or cooperative, any associated fees are
                also
                considered. Your mortgage costs should not exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly (pre-tax) income.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The second qualifying guideline relates to your total monthly housing costs
                and
                other debts you and any co-borrowers have. These costs should not exceed 36 percent of your gross
                monthly
                income.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Lenders follow these guidelines because they believe these percentages allow
                homeowners to pay off their mortgages fairly comfortably without the worry of loan defaults and
                foreclosures.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">However, these guidelines can be exceeded in certain cases, such as borrowers
                with a good credit history or with a larger down payment.</p>

            <h3>Qualifying Ratios</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Calculations that are used in determining whether a borrower can qualify for
                a
                mortgage. They consist of two separate calculations: a housing expense as a percent of income ratio and
                total debt obligations as a percent of income ratio.</p>

            <h3>Quitclaim Deed</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A deed that transfers without warranty whatever interest or title a grantor
                may
                have at the time the conveyance is made.</p>

                health problems.</p>

            <h3>Rate Caps</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Lenders offer caps with their adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) so you can
                have
                more control over your monthly mortgage payment. Usually, there are two types of rate caps:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A per-adjustment cap, which specifies the most your interest rate can rise from one adjustment
                    period to
                    the next</li>
                <li>A lifetime adjustment cap, which specifies how much your interest rate can rise over the life of
                    your
                    loan</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Ask your lender about both caps when evaluating any ARM product.</p>

            <h3>Rate Lock</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A commitment issued by a lender to a borrower or other mortgage originator
                guaranteeing a specified interest rate for a specified period of time.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A fixed-rate mortgage that includes a provision that gives the borrower a
                one-time option to reduce the interest rate (without refinancing) during the early years of the mortgage
                term.</p>

            <h3>Ratified Sales Contract</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A ratified sales contract means both the buyer and the seller have signed off
                on
                the final offer. It also acts as a starting point for the loan application interview.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The ratified sales contract specifies the amount of your down payment, the
                price
                you will pay for the house, the type of mortgage financing you will seek, your proposed closing and
                occupancy dates, and other contingencies.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">You will give all this information to your loan officer when you meet to
                discuss
                your financing options.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Many homeowners hire a real estate attorney to represent them during the loan
                application process. If you do so, your attorney will review the sales contract and represent you at
                closing.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">There are many questions you can ask a personal attorney before deciding
                whether
                to have the attorney represent you at closing. They can include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>What is the attorney’s fee for representing you at closing?</li>
                <li>What is the attorney’s experience with real estate transactions?</li>
                <li>Are there fees for reading documents relating to the closing?</li>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Remember that your personal attorney’s fee is not part of your closing costs.
                You
                must pay for this expense separately.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Buyers and sellers often negotiate who will pay certain closing costs, and
                the
                results vary depending on the negotiated deal. In fact, it’s not uncommon for a sales agreement to state
                that either the buyer or seller pays all closing costs. The agreement that you and the seller reach must
                be
                specified in the sales contract.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your negotiations could depend on a variety of factors, including the quality
                of
                the home, how long the home has been on the market, whether there are any other interested buyers, and
                how
                motivated the seller is to sell the home.</p>

            <h3>Servicer</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An organization that collects principal and interest payments from borrowers
                and
                manages borrowers’ escrow accounts. The servicer often services mortgages that have been purchased by an
                investor in the secondary mortgage market.</p>

            <h3>Servicing</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The collection of mortgage payments from borrowers and related
                responsibilities
                of a loan servicer.</p>

            <h3>Settlement</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The final step before you get the keys to your home is a formal meeting
                called
                the closing. It is at this meeting in which ownership of the home is transferred from the seller to the
                buyer.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Also called a settlement in some parts of the country, the meeting is
                typically
                attended by the buyer(s), the seller(s), their attorneys if they have them, both real estate sales
                professionals, a representative of the lender, and the closing agent. The purpose is to make sure the
                property is physically and legally ready to be transferred to you.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Several closing costs will be paid at this meeting. These expenses are over
                and
                above the price of the property and are incurred when ownership of a property is transferred. Closing
                costs
                generally include a loan origination fee, an attorney’s fee, taxes, an amount placed in escrow, and
                charges
                for obtaining title insurance, and a survey. Closing costs vary according to the area of the country.
            </p>

            <h3>Settlement Sheet</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The HUD-1 Settlement Statement itemizes the amounts to be paid by the buyer
                and
                the seller at closing. The (blank) form is published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
                Development
                (HUD).</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Items on the statement include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>real estate commissions</li>
                <li>loan fees</li>
                <li>points</li>
                <li>escrow amounts</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The form is filled out by your closing agent and must be signed by the buyer
                and
                the seller. The buyer should be allowed to review the HUD-1 Settlement Statement on the business day
                before
                the closing meeting to know the closing costs in advance.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The HUD-1 Settlement Statement is also known as the “closing statement” or
                “settlement sheet.”</p>

            <h3>Short Sale</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A property sale negotiated with a mortgage company in which a lender takes
                less
                than the total amount due.</p>

            <h3>Single-Family Properties</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">One- to four-unit properties including detached homes, townhomes,
                condominiums,
                and cooperatives.</p>

            <h3>Six-Month Adjustable-Rate Mortgage</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">This adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) offers a low initial interest rate for
                the
                first six months with an interest rate that adjusts every six months thereafter. The rate caps per
                adjustment can be 1 percent or 2 percent; the lifetime adjustment caps can be 4 percent, 5 percent, or 6
                percent. This type of mortgage may be right for you if you anticipate a rapid increase in income over
                the
                first few years of your mortgage. That’s because it lets you maximize your purchasing power immediately.
                It
                may also be the right mortgage for you if you plan to live in your home for only a few years.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The interest rate is tied to a published financial index. When comparing ARMs
                that have different indexes, look at how the index has performed recently. Your an approved lender can
                provide information on how to track a specific index and how to review a 15-year history of the index.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Maximizes your buying power immediately, especially if you expect your income to rise quickly in the
                    next few years.</li>
                <li>Lets you select an index that meets your financial needs.</li>
                <li>Easier to qualify for due to a low interest rate and a 1 or 2 percent annual rate cap.</li>
                <li>Some six-month ARMs let you convert to a fixed-rate loan at certain adjustment intervals. Ask your
                    Fannie Mae approved lender which of their six-month ARMs include this option. Your lender can also
                    provide further specifics about this mortgage option.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Details:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You can get a six-month ARM with a term of 10 to 30 years. Typically, they are 10, 15, or 30 years.
                </li>
                <li>Can be used to buy one- to four-family, owner-occupied principal residences including second homes,
                    investment properties, and condos, co-ops and planned unit developments.</li>
                <li>Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must be built on a permanent
                    chassis
                    at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Special Deposit Account</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An account that is established for rehabilitation mortgages to hold the funds
                needed for the rehabilitation work so they can be disbursed from time to time as particular portions of
                the
                work are completed.</p>

            <h3>Standard Payment Calculation</h3>

            <p>The method used to determine the monthly payment required to repay the remaining balance of a mortgage in
                substantially equal installments over the remaining term of the mortgage at the current interest rate.
            </p>

            <h3>Step-Rate Mortgage</h3>

            <p>A mortgage that allows for the interest rate to increase according to a specified schedule (i.e. seven
                years), resulting in increased payments as well. At the end of the specified period, the rate and
                payments
                will remain constant for the remainder of the loan.</p>

            <h3>Subdivision</h3>

            <p>A housing development that is created by dividing a tract of land into individual lots for sale or lease.
            </p>

            <h3>Subordinate Financing</h3>

            <p>Any mortgage or other lien that has a priority that is lower than that of the first mortgage.</p>

            <h3>Subprime</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Designating a loan (typically at a greater than usual rate of interest)
                offered
                to a borrower who is not qualified for other loans (e.g. because of poor credit history).</p>

            <h3>Subsidized Second Mortgage</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An alternative financing option known as the Community Seconds® mortgage for
                low-
                and moderate-income households. An investor purchases a first mortgage that has a subsidized second
                mortgage
                behind it. The second mortgage may be issued by a state, county, or local housing agency, foundation, or
                nonprofit corporation. Payment on the second mortgage is often deferred and carries a very low interest
                rate
                (or no interest rate). Part of the debt may be forgiven incrementally for each year the buyer remains in
                the
                home.</p>

            <h3>Survey</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A drawing or map showing the precise legal boundaries of a property, the
                location
                of improvements, easements, rights of way, encroachments, and other physical features.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your lender may require you to have a survey of the property performed. This
                process confirms that the property’s boundaries are correctly described in the purchase and sale
                agreement.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Also called a plot plan, the survey may show a neighbor’s fence is located on
                the
                seller’s property or more serious violations may be discovered. These violations must be addressed
                before
                the lender will proceed.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The buyer usually pays to have the survey done, but some cost savings may be
                found by requesting an “update” from the company that previously surveyed the property.</p>

            <h3>Sweat Equity</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Contribution to the construction or rehabilitation of a property in the form
                of
                labor or services rather than cash.</p>

            <h3>Taxes and Insurance</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">You’ll hear many terms as you work with your mortgage lender, and one of the
                most
                frequently mentioned is “PITI.” This abbreviation stands for principal, interest, taxes and insurance.
            </p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The tax and insurance components of a mortgage payment are generally held by
                the
                lender in an escrow account. The lender pays any property tax and homeowner’s insurance bills as they
                are
                due, ensuring they are paid on time.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A home buyer’s monthly mortgage payment generally covers expenses through the
                escrow account. If you don’t have your homeowner’s insurance and property taxes paid out of a lender
                escrow
                account, your local government and your property insurance company will send payment notices directly to
                you. It is your responsibility to make sure you pay these bills on time.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">If you’re planning to purchase a condominium or cooperative, talk to your
                lender
                about how they view condo and co-op fees. Most likely, they are considered housing costs and not a part
                of
                PITI. However, this can vary from lender to lender.</p>

            <h3>Tenancy by the Entirety</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A type of joint tenancy of property that provides right of survivorship and
                is
                available only to a husband and wife. Contrast with tenancy in common.</p>

            <h3>Tenancy in Common</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A type of joint tenancy in a property without right of survivorship. Contrast
                with tenancy by the entirety and with joint tenacy.</p>

            <h3>Tenant-Stockholder</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The obligee for a cooperative share loan, who is both a stockholder in a
                cooperative corporation and a tenant of the unit under a proprietary lease or occupancy agreement.</p>

            <h3>Termite Inspection</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Homes in many parts of the country must be inspected for termites before they
                can
                be sold. You should receive a certificate from a termite inspection firm stating that the property is
                free
                of both visible termite infestation and termite damage.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The cost of the termite inspection is usually paid by the seller, and the
                seller’s real estate sales professional orders the inspection. You need to make sure that the original
                certificate is delivered to your lender at least three days before closing.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">This allows the lender to review the certificate and address any potential
                problems.</p>

            <h3>Third-Party Origination</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A process by which a lender uses another party to completely or partially
                originate, process, underwrite, close, fund, or package the mortgages it plans to deliver to the
                secondary
                mortgage market.</p>

            <h3>Thrifts</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Thrifts are depository institutions that primarily serve consumers and
                include
                both savings banks and savings and loan (S&amp;L) institutions. These institutions originate and service
                mortgage loans. A thrift may choose to hold a loan in its own portfolio or sell the loan to an investor.
            </p>

            <h3>Title</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A legal document evidencing a person’s right to or ownership of a property.
            </p>

            <h3>Title Company</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A company that specializes in examining and insuring titles to real estate.
            </p>

            <h3>Title Insurance</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Insurance that protects the lender (lender’s policy) or the buyer (owner’s
                policy) against loss arising from disputes over ownership of a property.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your lender will require that you buy title insurance to ensure that you are
                receiving a “marketable title”. There are two types of title insurance policies:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Lender’s policy (mandatory): This protects the lender should a flaw in the title be detected after
                    the
                    property has been purchased.</li>
                <li>Owner’s policy (optional, but recommended): This protects you should a flaw in the title be detected
                    after the property has been purchased.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Generally, the buyer pays the cost of both policies. Check with your insurer,
                because you may receive a price break if you seek a combined lender/owner policy or if you purchase a
                “reissue” policy from the company that previously insured the title.</p>

            <h3>Title Search</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A check of the title records to ensure that the seller is the legal owner of
                the
                property and that there are no liens or other claims outstanding.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">In order to make sure the borrower will receive clear title to the property,
                lenders require a title search. It attempts to uncover any “encumbrances” on the title and makes sure
                the
                seller is the actual owner of the property.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Encumbrances include any liens - legal claims against a property filed by
                creditors as a means to collect unpaid bills. Liens can also be filed by the Internal Revenue Service
                for
                nonpayment of taxes. Any such claims must be paid by the seller - this often occurs either before or at
                the
                closing.</p>

            <h3>Total Expense Ratio</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Total obligations as a percentage of gross monthly income. The total expense
                ratio includes monthly housing expenses plus other monthly debts.</p>

            <h3>Townhouse</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A townhouse is similar to a condominium in that it’s a type of joint real
                estate
                where each housing unit is individually owned. However, it has two or more stories, rather than the
                typical
                one floor found in a condominium.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Townhouses are available in many shapes and sizes, and most may have yards or
                common spaces that can be used by the owners.</p>

            <h3>Trade Equity</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Equity that results from a property purchaser giving his or her existing
                property
                (or an asset other than real estate) as trade as all or part of the down payment for the property that
                is
                being purchased.</p>

            <h3>Transfer of Ownership</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Any means by which the ownership of a property changes hands. Lenders
                consider
                all of the following situations to be a transfer of ownership: the purchase of a property “subject to”
                the
                mortgage, the assumption of the mortgage debt by the property purchaser, and any exchange of possession
                of
                the property under a land sales contract or any other land trust device. In cases in which an inter
                vivos
                revocable trust is the borrower, lenders also consider any transfer of a beneficial interest in the
                trust to
                be a transfer of ownership.</p>

            <h3>Transfer Tax</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">State or local tax payable when title passes from one owner to another.</p>

            <h3>Treasury Index</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">An index that is used to determine interest rate changes for certain
                adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) plans. It is based on the results of auctions that the U.S. Treasury
                holds
                for its Treasury bills and securities or is derived from the U.S. Treasury’s daily yield curve, which is
                based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter
                market.</p>

            <h3>Trustee</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A fiduciary who holds or controls property for the benefit of another.</p>

            <h3>Truth-In-Lending</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">A federal law that requires lenders to fully disclose, in writing, the terms
                and
                conditions of a mortgage, including the annual percentage rate (APR) and other charges.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Your lender should provide you with the Truth-in-Lending (TIL) Statement
                within
                three business days of your loan application. This document outlines the costs of your loan, and it is
                given
                to you so you can compare the costs with those of other lenders. Among the costs listed:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The annual percentage rate (APR), which is the cost of your mortgage compiled as a yearly rate. It
                    may
                    be higher than the interest rate stated in your mortgage because it includes points and other costs
                    of
                    credit.</li>
                <li>The finance charge.</li>
                <li>The amount financed.</li>
                <li>The payment amount.</li>
                <li>The total payments required.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The lender is required to give you the final version of your TIL Statement at
                or
                prior to the closing meeting because it is possible that the APR calculated at your loan application
                will
                change at closing.</p>

            <h3>Two-Step Mortgage</h3>

            <p class="glossary_definition">The Two-Step Mortgage is a special type of adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)
                that
                adjusts only once. Depending on whether you select a five-year or seven-year Two-Step Mortgage, your
                interest rate will adjust once at the end of either five or seven years. Then, your interest rate stays
                the
                same for the remaining 25 or 23 years of your 30-year loan.</p>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Advantages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You can qualify with a low starting interest rate. Your initial interest rate is only slightly
                    higher
                    than a balloon loan and is often lower than a 30-year fixed rate loan.</li>
                <li>You get stable, predictable payments for five or seven years and, after adjustment, for the
                    remaining 25
                    or 23 years of the loan.</li>
                <li>You are protected from rising interest rates during the early years of homeownership.</li>
                <li>You do not have to re-qualify or pay refinance costs at the time the interest rate adjusts.</li>
                <li>You have time to increase your earnings or accumulate additional assets before the interest rate
                    adjusts
                    at the end of five or seven years.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="glossary_definition">Details:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your interest rate cap can be no more than 6 percent above your initial interest rate.</li>
                <li>You can use this mortgage to buy one- to four-family residences including second homes and condos,
                    co-ops and planned unit developments.</li>
                <li>Manufactured homes are also eligible. (Manufactured housing units must be built on a permanent
                    chassis
                    at a factory and then transported to a permanent site and attached to a foundation.)</li>
